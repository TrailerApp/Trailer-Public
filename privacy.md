## Trailer App Privacy Policy

Trailer app does not collect any of your personal data. 
 - all `.trailer` and `.trailertemplate` files are stored on your local hard drive.

Trailer app does not record videos from your macOS device camera.
 - all videos recorded in the app are stored on your local hard drive.
 - all videos that you record are available as preview in the `Record` inspector interface, and you can also delete them from there. 
 - For recording a video from your iOS device, we ask for Camera permission (`NSCameraUsageDescription`), but this is a requirement that is mandated by Apple
   and that we cannot circumvent.
